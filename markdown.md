.quote[The message text was the word login; on an earlier attempt the l and the o
letters were transmitted, but the system then crashed. Hence, the literal first
message over the ARPANET was .bold[lo]. About an hour later, after the programmers
repaired the code that caused the crash, the SDS Sigma 7 computer effected a
full login.]

# Routing

The process of selecting a path for traffic in a network

# Router

The thingâ„¢ which does the routing

---

class: inverse

# How does a router work?

It forwards a packet from one network interface to another network interface. In
order to do so it uses a .bold[routing table], which maps various destinations
to specific interfaces. This routing table has to be updated in real-time.

# How can we build a topology of the network?

# Link-state routing protocol

Each router:

1. Determines its direct neighbours
2. Periodically sends a link-state message
3. Creates a map of the network

---

class: left

# Link-state message, you say?

The link-state message contains:

1. The name of the sender
2. The list of directly connected neighbours
3. A number which identifies the version of the message

class: inverse

# The routing table

Each node runs an algorithm over the map to determine the shortest path from
itself to every other node in the network. Dijkstra's algorithm is a good choice.
